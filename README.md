DateClass.cpp:
------------------------------
The realisation of the following task:

We have a date object and some functions it provides: 

-is current year LEAP or it isn't

-compare to dates by count of days between them

-add some days to current date

-etc

We realise two classes that were inherited from previous one named Date, them has different way of output: CDate0 write the current date with English while CDate1 uses Russian. Both classes have functions of file output.

Moreover we need to have an opportunity to read the following information from the file:  I filename dd mm yy, where I is a type of class. So we provide the fabricks mechanism to read such information from file and construct the vector of CDates
